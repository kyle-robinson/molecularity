CC BY-SA: This license allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, so long as attribution is given to the creator. The license allows for commercial use. If you remix, adapt, or build upon the material, you must license the modified material under identical terms. 

SIDE NOTE: In case you get too much bright on some of the HDRI, try lowering down the intensity or strenght of the emiter ( for example, in Blender set the background node strenght to 0.5 ) also, lowering a bit the saturation helps.

EHave fun on your space journey ;)
